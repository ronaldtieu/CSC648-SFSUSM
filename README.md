# CSC648-SFSU Social Media

For my capstone project, our team has decided to develop a social media platform utilizing JavaScript and Node.js for the frontend, with Express as the web application framework. For the backend architecture, we have chosen MySQL as our database management system.


This was a group project from CSC648, that I decided to go back and revise for fun.
