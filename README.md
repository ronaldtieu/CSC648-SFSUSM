# CSC648-SFSU Social Media

For my capstone project, our team has decided to develop a social media platform utilizing JavaScript and Node.js for the frontend, with Express as the web application framework. For the backend architecture, we have chosen MySQL as our database management system.

I have worked on the backend creating the Database and API's, as a project to push myself to continue my journey, I have made it a project to work on the FrontEnd.
